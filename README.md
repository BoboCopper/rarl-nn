# Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning in Matlab

This repository will be used to implement the [RARL Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02702) for a certain racing competition.

It will feature several working examples for
 * simple function approximation (AND, XOR, ...)
 * classification (MNIST)
 * Q-Learning (DQN, DDQN)
upon one can base future work on.

We will use the Neural Network Toolbox API.
