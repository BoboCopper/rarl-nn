# Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning in Matlab

This repository will be used to implement the [RARL Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02702) for a certain racing competition.

It will feature several working examples for
 * simple function approximation (AND, XOR, ...)
 * classification (MNIST)
 * Q-Learning (DQN, DDQN)
upon one can base future work on.

Because we didn't want to start from scratch, the matlab-only implementation is based on [this repository](https://github.com/ahoereth/matlab-neural-networks).
We will probably rewrite it in `C++` for speed and customization.
